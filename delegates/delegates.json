The current landscape of protocols, DAOs, and protocol governance is extremely nascent, and experienced hands like those of the GFX team are scarce.\n\nThe GFX team is comprised of heavy DeFi users, regular governance participants, and core community members of various protocols. While our predominant experience has been with Compound, Uniswap, and MakerDAO, we are excited to become involved with the Hop DAO.\n\n**What Voters Can Expect from GFX Labs:**  \nWe look forward to leveraging our learnings from other protocols and the deep relationships our team has fostered across DeFi, TradFi, governments, and academics.\n\nGFX has a record of rolling up our sleeves and getting work done. The GFX team has authored half of all successful proposals on Uniswap ([including the first cross-chain governance proposal](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/polygon-1bp-fee-tier/16488?u=gfxlabs)), listed multiple assets and developed the [price oracle](https://www.comp.xyz/t/oracle-contributor/1887) on Compound, and led efforts at MakerDAO to interface with regulators, lawmakers, and outside researchers. We actively work to find mutual benefits for protocols we cover to collaborate – such as the soon-to-be deployed [DAI Direct Deposit Module for MakerDAO to plug directly into Compound](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/signal-request-should-maker-prioritize-onboarding-a-compound-d3m/11997).\n\nDelegation to GFX Labs is a delegation to a governance team that is one of the most experienced in DeFi, able to facilitate partnerships, and with a track record of consistent engagement and delivery of results.\n\n**GFX Labs isn’t a fund. We don’t hold positions. We are a team of builders who love DeFi.** Our participation in governance is rooted in a desire to see DeFi overtake legacy finance. We promise to be active participants. We’ll explain not only when we agree, but most importantly, when we disagree. As first-hand participants in governance, we know how frustrating it is to work on a proposal, receive limited comments, only to have the proposal shot down at launch. Our door will always be open to those who share the passion for DeFi that we have.\n\n**Conflicts of Interest**  \nGFX Labs may from time to time be engaged as a delegate on other protocols. All governance participation is public and done through the same wallet.\n"

Since then I’ve tried every product I can get my hands on as I’ve honed my awareness for the things that matter, things like providing services as public goods that give far more to the community than they take as rewards. I am active on Reddit, Twitter, and Discord, and I founded the EthStaker community, a group of community custodians who educate about staking on Ethereum. As a self-described Ethereum-centrist, I do believe that Ethereum will be the settlement chain for the future of web3.\n\n**What voters can expect of me:** You can expect me to learn everything I can about Hop and share that knowledge with the rest of the ecosystem. If Hop continues to align with my beliefs regarding healthy ecosystem and ethos, I’ll continue to strengthen the relationship. If I feel that the community or leadership has lost its way I’ll work in good faith to help correct the course. I work hard to put my own ego in check and listen to the needs of others and do my best to draw attention and serve those needs."

        "info": "**ENS name**: hop.maaria.eth\n\n**My reasons for wanting to be a delegate:**  \nHop is a major reason I believe that Ethereum + Layer 2’s could be the winning ecosystem for dApps. Every time I’ve used Hop over the past year I have been magically delighted by the experience, especially compared to the usual 90 minute, butt-clenching, ‘did i just lose all my money’ bridge anxiety. I reached out to the Hop team last year to get more involved, and am now operating the USDT bonder with a small group of family and friends.\n\nThe low transaction fees and high throughput of L2s have the potential to unlock so many new applications that are currently not possible or scalable on mainnet. L2s have struggled with adoption though, largely due to the difficulty of moving assets on and off these chains. Until Hop, the L2 bridging experience included long settlement times, bad UX, security concerns, etc. By focusing solely on L2s, Hop created a seamless bridging experience with a single wallet interface and instant settlement of assets.\n\nI often think about crypto infrastructure as a series of building blocks that unlock new capabilities and behaviors and in my opinion, L2s will be a big unlock for mainstream crypto adoption. Hop plays an important role in making L2 blockchains more accessible, which in turn will drive broader crypto adoption and usability. Operating the USDT bonder and providing utility to the Hop community has been incredibly fulfilling and meaningful for me personally, and I’m looking forward to continuing to build with you all as both a bonder operator and DAO delegate.\n\n**My web3 qualifications / skills:**\n\n* I have been investing and participating in Web3 since 2016\n* Investments include: Bison Trails, 0x, Dapper Labs, Zapper, POAP, XMTP, and many, many more\n* Have been operating the USDT bonder for Hop since the beginning of the year\n* On the Advisory Board for the ApeCoin Foundation\n* Co-Founder of Sixth Wall, a Web3 production studio, with Mila Kunis, Morgan Beller and Lisa Sterbakov.\n    * Most recent launch was a community-driven animated short series called The Gimmicks. NFTs were free to mint and holders were able to participate in the content creation process by voting on the show storyline every week.\n* I’ve been writing a weekly crypto newsletter since 2017: [thisweekincrypto.substack.com](http://thisweekincrypto.substack.com/)\n* ENS delegate and DAO member\n* I understand how to reach a new audience that isn’t crypto-native, and have spent many hours onboarding folks into crypto.\n\n**What voters can expect of me:**\n\n* Expect me to vote against proposals that are not beneficial to the long-term health of Hop. In general my philosophy is that treasury assets should be spent on 1) increasing utility of the protocol; or 2) providing a critical service for the protocol (i.e. Hop Labs for Hop Protocol).\n* The Hop bridge is a public utility and bonders are critical service providers.\n    * I believe the bonder service should move towards decentralization over time and be operated by the community.\n    * The short-term, mercenary capital dynamics we see in DeFi today won’t work for bonders, so as we progress towards decentralization we will need to consider new incentive structures that ensure bonding remains a viable service.\n* Though I won’t be super vocal on Discourse, Twitter or Discord, I will be thoughtful and deliberate about every vote cast.\n* I’m a big believer of the “strong convictions loosely held” mental model."

As a member of the Optimism team, this aligns very well with not only the ethos of our ecosystem but also myself. I’ve been a Hop user for quite some time now and after working with the team closely, I’d love to help push forward Hop and its values to a wider audience.\n\nOn top of that, Optimism is very focused on having effective governance in Web3. I’d love to help partner with Hop to pave the path to better governance paradigms in the space.\n\n**My web3 qualifications / skills:**\n\nI’m the Head of DeFi BD/Strategy at Optimism. I started out as a lead frontend engineer and prior to Optimism, I helped Synapse(another bridge protocol) with some dev related activities regarding their frontend. I’ve been in the space since 2015 as an investor, builder, and advocate for the Ethereum space. I’ve spent many years on-chain and playing around with a ton of protocols ranging from derivatives all the way to NFT gaming. Because of this I’ve also bridged through Hop and other bridge protocols a considerable amount. Overall, I have a deep passion for the space and specifically molding the future of governance in this world!\n\n**What voters can expect of me:**\n\nI will do my best to ensure that I am always aligned with the community and ethos of what Hop embodies. When voting, I will do my due diligence in making sure that I source feedback from the community to remove personal bias and selfish voting practices. As a member of the Optimism community, our values are aligned to push forward Ethereum and create a stronger transparent partnership between us as well! The Optimism ecosystem has been a long-term supporter of Hop Protocol and will continue to do so."
